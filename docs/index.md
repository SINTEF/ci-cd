# CI/CD tools

**Current version to use:** `v2.9.0`

!!! warning "Important"
    The default for `publish_on_pypi` in the [_CD - Release_ workflow](./workflows/cd_release.md) has changed from `true` to `false` in version `2.8.0`.

    To keep using the previous behaviour, set `publish_on_pypi: true` in the workflow file.

    This change has been introduced to push for the use of PyPI's [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) feature, which is not yet supported by reusable/callable workflows.

    See the [Using PyPI's Trusted Publisher](./workflows/cd_release.md#using-pypis-trusted-publisher) section for more information on how to migrate to this feature.

Use tried and tested continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) tools from this repository.

Currently, the repository offers GitHub Actions callable/reusable workflows and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks.

## GitHub Actions callable/reusable Workflows

This repository contains reusable workflows for GitHub Actions.

They are mainly for usage with modern Python package repositories.

### Available workflows

The callable, reusable workflows available from this repository are described in detail in this documentation under the [Workflows](./workflows/index.md) section.

### General usage

See the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow) on the topic of calling a reusable workflow to understand how one can incoporate one of these workflows in your workflow.

!!! note
    Workflow-level set `env` context variables cannot be used when setting input values for the called workflow.
    See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#env-context) for more information on the `env` context.

Under the [Workflows](./workflows/index.md) section for each available workflow, a usage example will be given.

## pre-commit hooks

This repository contains hooks for keeping the documentation up-to-date, making available a few [invoke](https://pyinvoke.org) tasks used in the reusable workflows.

By implementing and using these hooks together with the workflows, one may ensure no extra commits are created during the workflow run to update the documentation.

### Available hooks

The pre-commit hooks available from this repository are described in detail in this documentation under the [Hooks](./hooks/index.md) section.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD024 -->
### General usage

Add the hooks to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
See the [pre-commit webpage](https://pre-commit.com) for more information about how to use pre-commit.

Under the [Hooks](./hooks/index.md) section for each available hook, a usage example will be given.
