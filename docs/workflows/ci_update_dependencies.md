# CI - Update dependencies PR
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD038 -->

**File to use:** `ci_update_dependencies.yml`

This workflow creates a PR if there are any updates in the `permanent_dependencies_branch` branch that have not been included in the `default_repo_branch` branch.

This workflow works nicely together with the [CI - Check pyproject.toml dependencies](./ci_check_pyproject_dependencies.md) workflow, and the same value for `permanent_dependencies_branch` should be used.
In this way, this workflow can be called on a schedule to update the dependencies that have been merged into the `permanent_dependencies_branch` branch into the `default_repo_branch` branch.

The main point of having this workflow is to have a single PR, which can be squash merged, to merge several dependency updates performed by [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core) or similar.

As a "bonus" this workflow supports updating [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks.

!!! note "PR branch name"
    The generated branch for the PR will be named `ci/update-dependencies`.

!!! warning
    If a PAT is not passed through for the `PAT` secret and `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used, beware that any other CI/CD jobs that run for, e.g., pull request events, may not run since `GITHUB_TOKEN`-generated PRs are designed to not start more workflows to avoid escalation.
    Hence, if it is important to run CI/CD workflows for pull requests, consider passing a PAT as a secret to this workflow represented by the `PAT` secret.

!!! important
    If this is to be used together with the [CI/CD - New updates to default branch](./ci_cd_updated_default_branch.md) workflow, the `pr_body_file` supplied (if any) should be immutable within the first 8 lines, i.e., no check boxes or similar in the first 8 lines.
    Indeed, it is recommended to not supply a `pr_body_file` in this case.

      permanent_dependencies_branch: "ci/dependency-updates"
      default_repo_branch: stable
      pr_labels: "CI/CD"
      extra_to_dos: "- [ ] Make sure the PR is **squash** merged, with a sensible commit message.\n- [ ] Check related `requirements*.txt` files are updated accordingly."
      update_pre-commit: true
      python_version: "3.9"
